map-ping-lockout-ticks=The number of gameticks that must pass between consecutive pings. There are 60 ticks per second, so the default 120 ticks would be 2 seconds. This is a global limit, so one player pinging the map will thwart all other ping attempts globally for this duration.
map-ping-duration-ticks=This is how long a ping persists on the minimap, in units of game ticks. There are 60 ticks per second, so the default 480 ticks would be 8 seconds.
