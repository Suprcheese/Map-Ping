[mod-setting-description]
map-ping-lockout-ticks=  The number of gameticks that must pass between consecutive pings. There are 60 ticks per second, so the default 120 ticks would be 2 seconds. This is a global limit, so one player pinging the map will thwart all other ping attempts globally for this duration.
map-ping-duration-ticks=  This is how long a ping persists on the minimap, in units of game ticks. There are 60 ticks per second, so the default 480 ticks would be 8 seconds.
map-ping-clean-inventory=  Enabling this setting ensures your inventory remains clear of Map Ping Tools, thus effectively switching to a "hotkey-only" mode, where you rely exclusively on the Map Ping hotkey to ping the map.
map-ping-admin-panel=If enabled the admin panel will pop up every time you hold the tool in your hand.
